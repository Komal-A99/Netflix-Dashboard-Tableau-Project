# Projects
# Project Overview
ShotScope is a flu shot data visualization and analysis project aimed at improving healthcare decision-making by tracking flu immunization trends across various demographics and locations. The project leverages Tableau for data visualization and PostgreSQL for data management, streamlining the reporting process and enabling real-time tracking of flu shot data.

# Features
üìä Flu Shot Dashboard: Developed a comprehensive dashboard in Tableau to visualize flu vaccination trends.
üìà Trend Identification: Data analysis helped boost vaccination rates by 15% across different demographics and locations.
üöÄ Streamlined Data Processes: Integrated SQL with Tableau, cutting reporting time by 30% and enabling faster insights.
‚è±Ô∏è Real-time Tracking: Enabled real-time tracking of vaccination data, optimizing resource allocation and decision-making.
‚úÖ Improved Accuracy: SQL techniques improved reporting accuracy to 98%.

# Technologies
Tableau: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
PostgreSQL: Backend database used for data management.
SQL: Streamlined data integration and reporting processes.

# Objectives
Visualize flu immunization trends across regions and demographics.
Improve healthcare outcomes by boosting data visibility and vaccination rates.
Optimize the reporting process to make data more accessible and actionable for healthcare professionals.

# Data Source
The flu shot data was sourced from public health databases, containing vaccination records across various regions, age groups, and time periods. The dataset was cleaned and integrated into PostgreSQL for analysis and visualization.

# How to Use
Database Setup: Set up a PostgreSQL database and import the flu shot data.
Data Connection: Connect Tableau to the PostgreSQL database using a SQL connection.
Dashboard: Explore the pre-built dashboards in Tableau that track flu immunization trends in real time.
Customization: Customize the SQL queries and Tableau visualizations to match specific analysis needs or to explore other dimensions of the dataset.

# Results
15% Increase in Vaccination Rates: Actionable insights led to a significant improvement in vaccination efforts.
30% Faster Reporting: Data processes were optimized, reducing manual reporting time.
98% Reporting Accuracy: SQL-based validation ensured high accuracy in data reporting and analysis.

# Future Enhancements
Include additional data from other flu seasons or geographical areas.
Automate data extraction and loading for real-time updates.
Explore predictive analytics to forecast future vaccination trends and optimize distribution.
